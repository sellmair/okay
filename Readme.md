# This is a Sunday afternoon toy project!
This is just a fun toy project on 'how I would build' a Kotlin build system.



# Test this project
In order to install the build tool, please execute

```
./gradlew install
```

Then in the 'testProject' you could execute the `okayw` 

```shell
#!/bin/sh
cd testProject
./okayw build
```

Dependencies are defined in the `okay` file
